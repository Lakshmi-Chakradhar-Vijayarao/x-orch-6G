# Governance & Policy Health

Governance logic evaluates long-term policy behavior.

---

## Policy Health Metrics

Tracked metrics:
- Switch rate
- Action entropy
- NO_OP ratio

---

## Risk Classification

Risk levels:
- LOW: Stable, conservative behavior
- MEDIUM: Reactive but bounded
- HIGH: Oscillatory, unstable

Current experiments classify MARL behavior as **MEDIUM risk**, which is acceptable for dynamic systems.

---

## LLM Audit Role

LLMs are used exclusively to:
- Explain decisions
- Highlight risks
- Suggest caution

They never influence control actions.
